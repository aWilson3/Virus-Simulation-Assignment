# Virus Simulation
This is an assignment completed while taking "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science", an online course offered by MIT through edX.org. The goal of the assignment is to create simulations of a virus population within a patient. The problems in the assignment consider different classes of viruses and patients.

The class definitions/descriptions were given to us, and our job was to fill in the code for the methods of the classes, as well as write code for the simulation functions.
